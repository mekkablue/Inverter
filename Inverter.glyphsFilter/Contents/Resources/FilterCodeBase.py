"""
	Using Interface Builder (IB):
	
	Your code communicates with the UI through
	- IBOutlets (.py->GUI): values available to a UI element (e.g. a string for a text field)
	- IBActions (GUI->.py): methods in this class, triggered by buttons or other UI elements
	
	In order to make the Interface Builder items work, follow these steps:
	1. Make sure you have your IBOutlets (other than _theView)
	   defined as class variables at the beginning of this controller class.
	2. Immediately *before* the def statement of a method that is supposed to be triggered
	   by a UI action (e.g., setMyValue_() triggered by the My Value field), put:
		@objc.IBAction
	   Make sure the method name ends with an underscore, e.g. setValue_(),
	   otherwise the action will not be able to send its value to the class method.
	3. Open the .xib file in XCode, and add and arrange interface elements.
	4. Add this .py file via File > Add Files..., Xcode will recognize IBOutlets and IBACtions
	5. In the left sidebar, choose Placeholders > File's Owner,
	   in the right sidebar, open the Identity inspector (3rd icon),
	   and put the name of this controller class in the Custom Class > Class field
	6. IBOutlets: Ctrl-drag from the File's Owner to a UI element (e.g. text field),
	   and choose which outlet shall be linked to the UI element
	7. IBActions: Ctrl-drag from a UI element (e.g. button) to the Fileâ€™s Owner in the left sidebar,
	   and choose the class method the UI element is supposed to trigger.
	   If you want a stepping field (change the value with up/downarrow),
	   then select the Entry Field, and set Identity Inspector > Custom Class to:
		GSSteppingTextField
	   ... and Attributes Inspector (top right, 4th icon) > Control > State to:
		Continuous
	8. Compile the .xib file to a .nib file with this Terminal command:
		ibtool xxx.xib --compile xxx.nib
	   (Replace xxx by the name of your xib/nib)
	   Please note: Every time the .xib is changed, it has to be recompiled to a .nib.
	   Check Console.app for error messages to see if everything went right.
